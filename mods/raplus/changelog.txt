General changes
There are unified Allies and unified Soviets playable alongside the Nations
 - Just like in the succesful game C&C: Generals - Zero Hour, you can pick the 'vanilla' faction to play as, the 'vanilla' faction then lacks the special modifiers of the nations, but has (almost)unrestricted access to the unified arsenal of their faction
Countries have been reworked
Started with renaming England into Britain, proper. Their theme has been changed to Intelligence from Counter-Intelligence as soviets dont have an spy unit of any kind ingame.
Added an third Soviet nation: Kazakhstan, to even out the number of playable Allies and Soviet countries.

Each country:
 - has one tanks modifier
 This modifier affects your basic tanks. Those affected tanks are Light Tank, Medium Tank, Tank Destroyer for the Allies. Medium Tank (Soviet), Heavy Tank, Mammoth Tank for the Soviets
 British tanks deal more damage while being costlier to build, French tanks fire faster while dealing less damage per shot, German tanks are durabler yet cost more, Russian tanks are faster to build yet somewhat nimbler, Ukraine tanks have +1 range but less rate of fire, Kazakh tanks move faster and take longer to build
 - has one or two perks modifying other things
 British Spies are built as Veteran, France can build fake structures, Germans can use Advanced Chronoshift, Russian Powerplants provide extra juice, Ukraine can use advanced Iron Curtain, Kazakh A-Bomb gets prepared faster.
 - has one unique support power
 Britain gets GPS Scrambler, gives temporary invisibility to affected units, France has Decoy Army, upon use gets delivered an selection of Fake units at primary War Factory, Germany can use Paratanks, delivers one Medium and two Light tanks via airdrop.
 Russian EMP Bomb can be used to disable vehicles in target area, Ukraine's Cruise Missile Strike replaces Airstrike for them and delivers three V2 rockets to targeted area, Kazakhstan's Paranuke replaces Airstrike and delivers an low yield nuclear bomb parachuted on your target.
 - has up to four unique units
 Britain can train Snipers and build ECM Jammer. France can build Phase Tank and Transport. Germany can train Jumpjet Infantry and build Chrono Tank, Prism Tank.
 Russia can train Tesla Trooper, build Heavy Tesla Tank, Kirov Airship and Tesla Boat. Ukraine can train Bomb Dogs, build Mammoth KV-8, Demolition Truck and Flame Submarine. Kazakhstan can train Desolator, build ICBM Launcher or ICBM Submarine
 - an unique commando unit
 Tanya for Britain, Commando for France, Chrono Commando for Germany, Volkov for Russia, Natasha for Ukraine, Boris for Kazakhstan
 The unified factions can choose one at a time from the three
 - some restrictions may apply
 for example. Ukraine cant build Flame Tank, as it rolls out its own Flame Mammoth version instead.
 Randomization of factions got reworked
 - Random Faction gives either vanilla Allies or Soviet. Random Allies and Random Soviet gives one of the three allied or soviet nations. Random Any gives as its name implies anyone(and is the default random)

Default map lobby settings have been changed
 - Starting cash at 10k, Starting units at MCV only, Explored Map is on, Limit Build Area is ticked off, Game Speed is Fast.
Giants Ants as map creeps made possible, added checkbox for it(disabled by Default) 
 - When enabled mineshafts will periodically spawn Giant Ants that are hostile to all. There are multiple different types of Ants.
Scrap Metal added as game lobby option
 - When enabled destroyed units and structures leave behind scrap metal that is 1/2 of Ore's value.
 
The advice intervall for Low Power and Silos Needed audio increased to every 5 min.
The announcement was happening way too frequently.
 
Prequisites for units reset on owner change 
 - What this means is, fe. if you are Soviet and capture an Allied War Factory cant build Light Tanks from there. 
Its still possible to build other faction arsenal by capturing their Construction Yard(thus acquiring all of their blueprints)

Artillery type units are revealed when firing their primary weaponry
 - All Artillery units, Snipers, Mortar Troopers, Cruisers, Missile Submarines reveal their position for an brief duration when firing their weaponry.
This should help alerting the player being attacked where the hell is that shell coming from.
Units armed with Tesla weaponry consume Power now
-2 Power for each Shock Trooper and Tesla Trooper ; -4 Power for each Tesla Tank and Tesla Boat ; -8 Power for each Heavy Tesla Tank.
This change should ensure you reconsider to spam something else when playing as Soviets.


Mapping changes
Maps are properly categorized now (1v1, 2v2, 3v3, FFA, Naval, Fun, Mini, etc.)
Everything labelled as Conquest was getting on my nerves, so went ahead and sorted it out.
There is an amazing collection of new maps included with the mod
Total map count increased 528(including the blank Shellmap).
Defined clones of existing theatres for porting Tiberian Dawn maps to Red Alert and did so
You can play any Tiberian Dawn map in RA, enjoy!
Added three new tilesets: Jungle, Tropic and Subterran
Jungle is the improved version included in Combined Arms(originally from Tiberian Dawn), 
Tropic is TDX mod's Caribic tileset, 
and Subterran is the Cave tileset done for the Portable RA.


Economical changes
Major Economy change: Ore Refinery discards excess resources now 
Do actually manage your economy!
Silos provide secondary income now, aslong they are powered
The income provided is minor yet frequent
Heavily damaged Silo and Refineries leak credits and ore
While this means you could technically let ore Spawn in your base, the frequency of credit loss is to ensure its not practical to do so.
Mine and Gem Mine footprint edited to become ground passable 
That means it will no longer block any ground unit's movement. Ive felt this change was necessary as most often an shaft will end up being in the middle of an attack path on an competitive map. Also the fact Antfestation required it to function.
Added an extra type of Mine, the Ore Drill
This high-powered drill mine generates Ore twice as fast, its impassable unlike the shafts.


Graphical changes
Some Tanks got an new muzzle fx for their main gun cannon attacks.
All building Make anims have Tick: 80.

 - While the queue appears to all players of any faction, only Allies and France can build something with it. The progress bar not being displayed is intended.
Fake structures are built consistent at 1/4 of original price, instead 10% of original.
The prices are rounded down where applicable(Fake FIX 185 instead 187, etc.). Fake structures never get an discount from Industrial Plant or otherwise.

Veterancy changes
Only Veteran units can eject an Pilot
The Pilot can enter any friendly vehicle or aircraft for promoting it, increasing recipient's rank by rank of himself. 
Air units have more probability of spawning an survivor than ground vehicles, the chance decreases as the rank increases.

Soviets gained an method of providing veterancy
The new Field Command structure provides the Field Promotion support power. This support power when used delivers an special crate to target area that is configured to level up by one rank the recipient and those in the cells surrounding it.
This should even out the Allies advantage.

Seperated veterancy espionage reward for Airplane and Helicopters. 
 - That means infiltrating an Airfield will only upgrade Airplanes, while infiltrating an Helipad will grant veterancy for Helicopters
Ship Yards and Sub Pens can be infiltrated by an Spy to gain veterancy on ship and submarine units, although this is only possible if the Shipyard placement generously borders the shore.
